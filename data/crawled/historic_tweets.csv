On which ground has your team rejected my refund while the product is not delivered? If your team is accepting that we have taken action against this case to avoid future issues, then is it my fault?"
Rajhome,@rajhome20165,24/11/2025 08:00,"@rajhome20165 e @AmazonHelp #Amazon  India is indulging in unethical practiced non-challantly. I have been at receiving end on at least 8 occasions. They think, due to extant weak laws in India, on e-commerce regulatory mechanism, they can get away. Why take pains of doing the right thing a la U.S & Europe."

Marlon Ribunal,@MarlonRibunal,24/11/2025 11:00,"@AmazonHelp I think your rollout just didn't work well with older device. The way I look at it, this is not an isolated case. You have to release updates to fix it so that your latest features will work with older devices as well."
